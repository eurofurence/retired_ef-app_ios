The Eurofurence\r\ncharity this year is a story about exactly such a case.\r\n\r\nFor the first time, Eurofurence is supporting a charity that we already\r\nhad in the past. Some of you may still remember our lovely charity from\r\nEurofurence 19, the animal rescue center Wildtierhilfe Fiel e.V.\r\n\r\nThe Wildtierhilfe Fiel is a registered, non-profit animal charity organized\r\nby the family Fu\u00dfbahn. The main goals of this friendly charity are\r\nto take care of injured or orphaned wild animals of all sorts and nurse\r\nthem back to health as well as to foster and nurture young animals and\r\nfinally release them back to the wilderness. Especially hand-rearing\r\nthe many baby animals is a very demanding job, requiring care and\r\nattention day and night. This is particularly difficult since it is important\r\nthat the animals do not get used to humans, so they can be returned to\r\nthe great outdoors.\r\n\r\nAt EF19 we raised a great amount of money for them, which was very\r\nmuch needed and helped to build a lot of new shelters and pay for food\r\nand veterinary costs for all the many different animals they rescue,\r\nsave and release into the wild during every year. Tears of happiness\r\nwere shed when we announced the final amount on stage back then.\r\nUnfortunately, earlier this year, tears were shed again, but because of\r\na great disaster that hit the Wildtierhilfe Fiel.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of this year, the animal rescue center was hit by a very\r\nheavy storm, which destroyed about 80% of all shelters and enclosures.\r\nAlmost everything which they had built up, worked for and dedicated\r\ntheir lives to, was destroyed within a few hours! Luckily, most of the\r\nanimals could be saved or returned to the Wildtierhilfe Fiel after the\r\nstorm (which shows how much trust the animals have for them).\r\n\r\nAnd thankfully, Dirk and Rosi Fu\u00dfbahn, the family running the Wildtierhilfe\r\nFiel, received a lot of support from volunteers and donors, so they\r\ncould find the mental strength to continue, and to start rebuilding\r\neverything. With donations, they were able to rebuild some of the\r\nenclosures, so they could already take care of animals in need again,\r\nwhich is essential and important throughout the entire year. They still\r\nneed all the support they can get in order to continue to be able to pay\r\nfor the food and veterinary costs, and continue building up and improving\r\nthe rest of the shelters. We unanimously decided that Eurofurence\r\nwill be there for them again!","Position":"0","ImageId":null},{"Id":"a16af6df-9e9a-490d-a73d-6cb5e31cae1a","LastChangeDateTimeUtc":"2016-05-09T19:03:21Z","IsDeleted":"0","InfoGroupId":"8af4ad0f-3609-47ea-935e-e1b9911cd316","Title":"Airport Travel (Tegel \/ TXL)","Text":"Take the X9 bus line from the airport to the \"Jungfernheide\" bus stop.

Where to? Nobody knows these days. But the animals that were left behind on Earth  - along with some genetic experiments  - started a new civilization. In order to keep it \"civilized\", there are annual games where players can compete against each other in a non-violent way.\r\n\r\nAs usual, the competition is between teams of two, so if you are a suiter willing to participate, be sure to pair up and be ready!

From artificial storms to beverages that glow in the dark. From Emergency surgery to fur fumigation. Our all-purpose anthro lounge caters to all your needs. The Fursuit Lounge is a Fursuiters-Only area, intended to offer them a safe place to quickly cool down, get some refreshments, make repairs, dry their suits and change costumes without ruining the magic. To make the Fursuiters' stay in the Fursuit Lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n\r\n  - Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the Fursuit Lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n  - Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n  - The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n  - Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n  - Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\n**Important new rule!**\r\n\r\nYou will need a personal fursuit badge to enter the Fursuit-Louge. It is your access key out of suit. You do not need more than one badge, even if you have several suits. Please present your Fursuithead upon pick-up, so we know you really are a suiter :)\r\n\r\nOpening times: daily from 9am til 30 minutes after the last event\r\n\r\n**NEW: The little Oasis**\\\\\r\nWe realise that with the growing con and location, the main Fursuit Lounge may occasionally be a struggle to reach, if you are on the other end of the hotel. To help you survive, we have installed 'The Little Oasis' in the Estrel Saal Foyer, near the Lobby. (Last years lounge location). A small location with viewing protection and fresh water round the clock, for a quick heads-off cool down.","Position":"1","ImageId":null},{"Id":"e3fbe46f-6047-4774-b796-f0dd0cd80921","LastChangeDateTimeUtc":"2016-05-09T19:03:21Z","IsDeleted":"0","InfoGroupId":"77d4db64-c834-47bb-8991-c71a2479e484","Title":"Rhubarb the bear","Text":"Rhubarb the bear has a degree in Commercial Arranging from the Berklee College of Music and spent the last two and half decades performing and producing music for both TV and radio promotions as well as theme park shows.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, he discovered the furry fandom and soon after wrote the musical Julie Bunny Must Die!.
